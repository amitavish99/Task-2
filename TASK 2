Certainly! Sales prediction using machine learning in Python typically involves data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Here's a simplified outline to get you started:

1. Import Libraries
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
2. Load and Explore Data
python
Copy code
# Load your sales dataset
# Assuming you have a CSV file named 'sales_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())
3. Data Preprocessing
python
Copy code
# Handle missing values if any
data = data.dropna()

# Extract relevant features (advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, advertising platform)
features = data[['advertising_expenditure', 'target_audience_segmentation', 'advertising_platform']]
target = data['sales']

# Convert categorical features to numerical using one-hot encoding
features = pd.get_dummies(features, columns=['target_audience_segmentation', 'advertising_platform'], drop_first=True)

# Standardize numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
features[['advertising_expenditure']] = scaler.fit_transform(features[['advertising_expenditure']])
4. Model Training
python
Copy code
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model (using Linear Regression for simplicity)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
5. Model Evaluation
python
Copy code
# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
This is a basic example using linear regression. Depending on your dataset characteristics, you might want to explore more advanced regression techniques, fine-tune your model, and conduct feature selection.
